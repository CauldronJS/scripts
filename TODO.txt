- Investigate the async iteration to speed it up during buffer reading
- Compiling the deps directory only when need-be and not every time (this may be platform specific)
- Create a Cauldron VM class that manages all injection and globals in Java
  * can help with event registering
  * async event timings
  * globals
  * native/internal libraries
  * interaction with external JARs
- figure out if I need to make FS and PATH modules relative to the file calling
them. Not sure how I'd do that, but fuck it, anything is possible, right?
