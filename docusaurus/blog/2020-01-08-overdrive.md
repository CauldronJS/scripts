As most of you know, Cauldron has been through quite a bit over the past year. What started as a goal to embed NodeJS inside of Spigot has now extended to a full-blown project of embed NodeJS _everywhere_. This is cool because I never would have imagined trying to get this to work with Forge, Sponge, or Bungee (maybe even Vanilla one day, who knows). But before that, lets take a step back and look at the timeline.

Q1 2019:
- Core plugin with GraalVM
- NodeJS module support
- Recreation of 25% of core NodeJS libraries

Q2 2019:
- 50% of core NodeJS libraries complete
- Plan for future rework of JS VMs within Spigot
- Anticipate embedding of CauldronJS outside of Spigot

Q3 2019:
- Split from NamelessNoobs
- Break internal library out from JS

Q4 2019:
- Slack (a lot)
- [Acquire new servers and landing page](https://cauldronjs.com)
- Begin elevation of CauldronJS to multithreaded capability and Paper functionality

Q1 2020:
- Back in force with full swing
- Create new documentation site
- Finish CauldronJS core VM implementation
- 25% breaking internal modules and polyfills into Cauldron
