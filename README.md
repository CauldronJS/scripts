# Cauldron Scripts
> A starter script collection for the Cauldron plugin

## Warning!

None of these scripts will work with Rhino/Nashorn simply due to the fact that this project is somewhat ES6 compliant (of which neither of those two engines are). These are all developed on the GraalVM. Currently these are also not usable on Windows _until_ Oracle comes out with a version of the Windows GraalVM that is ES6 compatible. If you'd like to get around that, check out [this documentation](/docs/running-on-windows).
